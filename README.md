# robot-pathfinding-astar

An implementation of the A Star algorithm for a robot moving on a NxN tile. The robot can only see and move to adjacent tiles but retains memory of visited tiles. The A-Star algorithm is used in conjunction with a Depth-First-Search algorithm, tailored specifically to support the A-Star in moving the robot towards non-adjacent tiles. The algorithm's speed is acceptable.
